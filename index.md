title: Introduction to Lean UX

*An interactive guide (and template) on how to plan and structure projects that use experiments to drive toward outcomes, using agile and scrum methodologies.*

###What is lean UX?

Lean UX is a collaborative, outcome-focused product development and project management philosophy and process. It builds on agile and lean principles and provides a structured way to build software through quick, iterative experiments — all within a scrum and agile sprint framework. *Note: Lean UX can be adapted to other management and development frameworks, such as Kanban, but for this guide we will focus on scrum and agile.*
 
Doing lean UX means fundamentally changing your team’s focus from outputs (for example, features, functionality, colors) to outcomes (the changes in user behavior you want to see). 

###How does lean UX work?

Lean UX happens through hypothesis-driven development. Instead of thinking of a project as a set of requirements to complete, think of it as a set of educated guesses about what will accomplish the desired outcomes — for both the business and the end user. Your project can be seen as a series of experiments that you are consistently conducting in close collaboration with your users. Each experiment informs the next so that you’re always building on the things that bring you closer to your desired outcomes and removing or adjusting things that are not helping you reach your goals.

These hypotheses start at the very beginning of your project discovery process by explicitly identifying and tackling the business assumptions around the product. For example, it is equally important to test your assumptions about who your target audience is (and how to reach them) as it is to test assumptions about a feature of the product. In lean UX, the idea is for the whole project team to think holistically and not separate product development from project strategy.

**In general, the lean UX process has these steps**

>1. [Conduct discovery research]({{site.baseurl}}/1-discovery-research/)  
2. [Write a problem statement]({{site.baseurl}}/2-problem-statement/)  
3. [Identify assumptions]({{site.baseurl}}/3-identify-assumptions/)  
4. [Select assumptions]({{site.baseurl}}/4-select-assumptions/)  
5. [Develop broad hypotheses]({{site.baseurl}}/5-develop-hypotheses/)  
6. [Prioritize broad hypotheses]({{site.baseurl}}/6-prioritize/)  
7. [Break down broad hypotheses]({{site.baseurl}}/7-break-down/)  
8. [Groom the backlog]({{site.baseurl}}/8-groom-backlog/)  
9. [Plan the sprint and kick off the agile cycle]({{site.baseurl}}/9-plan-sprint-agile/)  

A note for UX practitioners: Lean UX may change how you do UX research. Some UX practitioners are used to writing big reports at the conclusion of their research. In Lean UX, iteration and learning over repeated experiments is valued over breadth of research. You should document the results of your hypothesis test clearly and concisely so you can share them quickly with your team, learn from them, and devise another experiment.
