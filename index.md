###What is lean product design?
Lean product design is an approach to building products that encompasses a set of ideas about collaboration, design, and project management that helps us focus not just on what we build, but on the outcomes we are seeking. 

At the core of lean product design is "hypothesis-driven development." The idea is to acknowledge that much of what we believe about a problem, solution, and our users are assumptions that need to be tested. To do this, we build in small, iterative pieces with the primary objective being learning whether the intended idea or feature is having the outcomes we want - both for the business and for our end users.

###Why use a lean approach?
When building digital tools and services, it’s very easy to think about our work in terms of features. But our users don’t care about what features our sites have; they care about what they can accomplish with them. And the people and agencies who own the sites don’t actually care about features either. They care about what mission and business goals the site helps them accomplish.

Even in an agile development process, it’s easy to lose track of the outcomes we’re trying to achieve. And we often don’t measure them until the end. Lean product design forces us to check, as we build each piece, how it works and what it accomplishes.

###Our Guide
In order to reflect on what we’ve learned in trying this approach, and to help other digital teams who might be interested, we’ve written a detailed step-by-step reference guide, which includes:
>- Steps for planning and executing a project with lean in mind
- A process for distilling assumptions into hypotheses 
- How to use existing tools to efficiently track hypothesis-driven development
- Tips for doing user research within an agile development process

“Lean” approaches to user experience vary, so keep in mind that this is just one perspective on trying to pull it all together. That said, we’re excited to open source our guide and share it with you!

*Note: It can be adapted to other management and development frameworks, such as Kanban, but for this guide we will focus on doing lean product design using scrum and agile.*

###Who’s this guide for?
We originally wrote this guide to communicate our process (and serve as a reference) to colleagues who are less familiar with this approach. While we have used it primarily in a digital software context, it may be useful to anyone involved in planning and building a project.

 
Doing lean product design means fundamentally changing your team’s focus from outputs (for example, features, functionality, colors) to outcomes (the changes in user behavior you want to see). 

###How does lean product design work?

At the core of lean product design is hypothesis-driven development. Instead of thinking of a project as a set of requirements to complete, think of it as a set of educated guesses about what will accomplish the desired outcomes — for both the business and the end user. Your project can be seen as a series of experiments that you are consistently conducting in close collaboration with your users. Each experiment informs the next so that you’re always building on the things that bring you closer to your desired outcomes and removing or adjusting things that are not helping you reach your goals.

These hypotheses start at the very beginning of your project discovery process by explicitly identifying and tackling the business assumptions around the product. For example, it is equally important to test your assumptions about who your target audience is (and how to reach them) as it is to test assumptions about a feature of the product. In lean product design, the idea is for the whole project team to think holistically and not separate product development from project strategy.

**In general, the process has these steps**

>1. [Conduct discovery research]({{site.baseurl}}/1-discovery-research/)  
2. [Write a problem statement]({{site.baseurl}}/2-problem-statement/)  
3. [Identify assumptions]({{site.baseurl}}/3-identify-assumptions/)  
4. [Select assumptions]({{site.baseurl}}/4-select-assumptions/)  
5. [Develop broad hypotheses]({{site.baseurl}}/5-develop-hypotheses/)  
6. [Prioritize broad hypotheses]({{site.baseurl}}/6-prioritize/)  
7. [Break down broad hypotheses]({{site.baseurl}}/7-break-down/)  
8. [Groom the backlog]({{site.baseurl}}/8-groom-backlog/)  
9. [Plan the sprint and kick off the agile cycle]({{site.baseurl}}/9-plan-sprint-agile/)
