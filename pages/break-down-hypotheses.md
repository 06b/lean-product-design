title: Select & Break Down Hypotheses
---


**4. These are your hypotheses. They may be broad at this point.
As a team, select 3 to 5 of the most compelling hypotheses to tackle.**

For example, you might want to select the least known hypotheses - the
ones your team is most unsure about - in order to learn quickly about
possible risks.

Or, you might select the top three that have the most compelling or
desired outcomes. The main idea here is that by making a selection, you
and your product owner are prioritizing and choosing a direction.




**5. Break these down into more concrete feature/action hypotheses. You
may need to break them down several times.**

Example:

We believe that **creating medicine** for **people** will result in
**increased** **safety**. We’ll know we’re right when we see **fewer
people die from disease**.

Might break down to:

We believe that **developing a cough syrup** for **children** will
result in **better child health and safety**. We’ll know we’re right
when we see **decreased time (fewer days) exhibiting symptoms**.
