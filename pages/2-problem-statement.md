title: 2. Write a problem statement
---
Gather your research and use it to create a problem statement. Describe ways that you will know (or measure) when you have solved the problem.

Your turn: Write your project’s statement in the following format:  

 >We have observed that **[product/service/organization]** isn’t meeting
 **[these goals/needs]**, which is causing **[this adverse affect]**. How might we improve so that our
 product/service/team/organization is more successful based on **[these measurable
 criteria]**?

If you have trouble writing a narrow problem statement, brainstorm all the project’s possible goals, needs, and measurable criteria first. Then work as a group to select the most important ones and build your problem statement from there.  It is likely that this process will reveal multiple problem statements.  Your team will need to work to figure out which problem to pursue, and an appropriate way of scoping the statement so that there are some constraints on what the team is taking on.
