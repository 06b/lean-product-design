### Outcomes, not outputs
The team needs to shift its thinking to focus on what outcomes result from what we are building, rather than on producing specific features

### Learn and Respond
The goal at all times is to learn, by creating an experiment and observing the results. You then respond by feeding that learning back into the next experiment

### Cross-disciplinary teams
Teams should be cross-disciplinary, closely integrated, and include the client product owner as an active design participant

### Build Shared Understanding
Strive toward shared understanding at all times: The entire team participates in all activities together, from planning and problem framing to research, design, and execution

Take a holistic view of what to tackle with the team: Don’t silo “product strategy” work - such as thinking through assumptions around “how we think we'll reach our users” from the work of coding specific features.  This will give you more diverse perspectives and inputs, help reveal potential problems much earlier, and ensure everyone on the team understands the intended goals, which translates into informed discussions and decisions at every level.

### Make assumptions explicit
Make your assumptions explicit, and test the riskiest/most critical first

### Keep experiments light
So that you can move quickly and don't build too much investment in a particular solution

### Prioritization is your friend
Prioritization is the (not so) secret weapon to keep your efforts lean and focused

### Always think problem first
Always start a project by taking a fresh look at the problem(s) and doing some discovery
