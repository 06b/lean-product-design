title: Gather your research & create your problem statement
---

## Outcomes & Metrics (Lean UX) Framework

The following process will help you get your project started on the
right foot and oriented towards outcomes & metrics. Get the whole team together **(always include the product owner!)** for these activities.

1.  **Gather your knowledge/data/research about the problem space, and
    create a problem statement as follows:**

 We have observed that **[product/service/organization]** isn’t meeting
 **[these goals/needs]**, which is causing **[this adverse affect]** to
 our team/organization. How might we improve so that our
 team/organization is more successful based on **[these measurable
 criteria]**?

*Tip: If your team is having trouble narrowing down to a reasonable
sized problem statement, try brainstorming out goals/needs & success
criteria first, then coalescing as a group around the most
relevant/important ones:*

> isn’t meeting **[these goals/needs]**:

- 

> is more successful based on **[these measurable criteria]:**

-
