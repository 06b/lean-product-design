## Outcomes and metrics (Lean UX) framework

Gather your knowledge/data/research about the problem space, andcreate a problem statement as follows:

 We have observed that **[product/service/organization]** isn’t meeting
 **[these goals/needs]**, which is causing **[this adverse affect]** to
 our team/organization. How might we improve so that our
 team/organization is more successful based on **[these measurable
 criteria]**?

*Tip: If your team is having trouble narrowing down to a reasonably-sized problem statement, try brainstorming out goals, needs and success
criteria first, then coalescing as a group around the most
relevant or important ones:*

- isn’t meeting **[these goals/needs]**:
- is more successful based on **[these measurable criteria]:**
