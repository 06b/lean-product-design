title: 1. Conduct discovery research
---
Before you go any further, do some research to discover problems that need solving. Consider doing one or more of the following with both stakeholders and possible end users:

>- [Contextual inquiry](https://methods.18f.gov/contextual-inquiry/)[](https://methods.18f.gov/bodystorming/) 
- [Stakeholder and user interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) 
- [Journey Mapping](https://methods.18f.gov/journey-mapping/) 
- [Cognitive walkthroughs](https://methods.18f.gov/cognitive-walkthrough/) 
- [KJ Method](https://methods.18f.gov/kj-method/) 
- [Heuristic analysis ](https://methods.18f.gov/heuristic-analysis/) 


Your goal is to identify the challenges both groups face and the relationship between the two groups. Focus on the problems stakeholders have, not the potential solutions.


A note for UX practitioners: Lean product design may change how you do UX research. Some UX practitioners are used to writing big reports at the conclusion of their research. Here, iteration and learning over repeated experiments is valued over breadth of research. You should document the results of your hypothesis test clearly and concisely so you can share them quickly with your team, learn from them, and devise another experiment.
