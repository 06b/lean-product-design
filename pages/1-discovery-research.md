title: 1. Conduct discovery research
---
Before you go any further, do some research to discover problems that need solving. Consider doing one or more of the following with both stakeholders and possible end users:

>- [Bodystorming](https://methods.18f.gov/bodystorming/) 
- [Cognitive walkthroughs](https://methods.18f.gov/cognitive-walkthrough/) 
- [Contextual inquiry](https://methods.18f.gov/contextual-inquiry/)[](https://methods.18f.gov/bodystorming/) 
- [Heuristic analysis ](https://methods.18f.gov/heuristic-analysis/) 
- [Stakeholder and user interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) 

Your goal is to identify the challenges both groups face and the relationship between the two groups. Focus on the problems stakeholders have, not the potential solutions.
