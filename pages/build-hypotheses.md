title: Prioritize Assumptions, then Build Hypotheses
---

Now, bring the raw assumptions material together in the table
below.

You're starting to construct your hypotheses. For each hypothesis, state the metrics that you'll see to know if you are right or wrong.
They may be high-level, which is ok.

We believe that **(doing/building/creating this)** for **this user/persona** will result in **(this outcome)**. We’ll know we’re right when we see **(this signal / metric)**.
