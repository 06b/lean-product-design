To add new pages to the guide, first create a new
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) file in the
`pages/` directory of the repository. As an example, the Markdown text for
this page is
[`pages/new-page.md`](https://github.com/18F/guides-template/blob/gh-pages/pages/new-page.md).

Outcomes & Metrics (Lean UX) Framework

The following process will help you get your project started on the
right foot and oriented towards outcomes & metrics. Get the whole team
(**always include the product owner!**) together for these activities.

1.  **Gather your knowledge/data/research about the problem space, and
    > create a problem statement as follows:**

> We have observed that **[product/service/organization]** isn’t meeting
> **[these goals/needs]**, which is causing **[this adverse affect]** to
> our team/organization. How might we improve so that our
> team/organization is more successful based on **[these measurable
> criteria]**?
>
> *Tip: If your team is having trouble narrowing down to a reasonable
> sized problem statement, try brainstorming out goals/needs & success
> criteria first, then coalescing as a group around the most
> relevant/important ones:\
> *
>
> isn’t meeting **[these goals/needs]**:

-   

> is more successful based on **[these measurable criteria]:**

-   

**2. In response to the problem statement the team just created, the
team now maps out all the assumptions it has (everyone should
contribute) about the needs, the users, and the potential
solutions/features.**

**Needs/Solution Assumptions**

1.  I believe my users have a need to:

    -   -   

2.  I believe these needs can be solved with:

    -   -   

3.  I believe the \#1 value a user wants to get out of my service is:

    -   -   

4.  I believe the user can also get these additional benefits:

    -   -   

5.  I believe I will acquire the majority of my users through:

    -   -   

6.  I believe my biggest product risk is:

    -   

7.  We will solve this through:

    -   -   

8.  What other assumptions do we have that, if proven false, will cause
    > our project to fail?

    -   

**User Assumptions**

1.  Who is the user?

    -   -   

2.  What problems does our product solve?

    -   

3.  When and how is our product used?

    -   -   

4.  What features are important?

    -   -   

5.  How should our product look and behave?

**3. Now, bring the raw assumptions material together in the table
below. **

You are starting to construct your hypotheses. For each hypothesis, you
will state the metrics that you will see to know if you are right/wrong.
They may be high-level, which is ok.

  **We believe that (doing/building/creating this)**   **For this user/persona**   **Will result in (this outcome)**   **We’ll know we’re right when we see (this signal / metric)**
  ---------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                       

**4. These are your hypotheses. They may be broad at this point.\
As a team, select 3 to 5 of the most compelling hypotheses to tackle. **

For example, you might want to select the least known hypotheses - the
ones your team is most unsure about - in order to learn quickly about
possible risks.

Or, you might select the top three that have the most compelling or
desired outcomes. The main idea here is that by making a selection, you
and your product owner are prioritizing and choosing a direction.

**5. Break these down into more concrete feature/action hypotheses. You
may need to break them down several times.**

Example:

We believe that **creating medicine** for **people** will result in
**increased** **safety**. We’ll know we’re right when we see **fewer
people die from disease**.

Might break down to:

We believe that **developing a cough syrup** for **children** will
result in **better child health and safety**. We’ll know we’re right
when we see **decreased time (fewer days) exhibiting symptoms**.

**6. Prioritize these with the team & product owner. They should be
broken down to the point where they can become the source of user
stories, which will also be written as hypotheses. **

**\*\* TO DO: **

**→ Show how to flesh out hypotheses to user stories process, examples**

**→ Trello / story tracking**

**→ Show how to integrate w/ Agile, user research**

**→ Visualize cycle/process**
