title: 4. Select assumptions
---
Now we select the assumptions we need to test. Identify assumptions above that meet one (or more) of the following conditions:

>- **Core assumptions**: Any assumptions that must be true for your solution to fix the problem (as listed in your problem statement). 
- **Unknown assumptions**: The ones your team is most unsure about — in order to learn quickly about possible risks.   
- **Risky assumptions**: Assumptions that — if proven wrong — would cause the project to fail. 
  

Your turn: With your team, read through your assumptions above and highlight those that are core, unknown, or risky. Tip: It may be helpful to have each team member do this activity individually, then come together for discussion.
